## Session in progress: PR #1092 — VA CRD removal analysis

Analysis of the va removal proposal (PR #1092). Short review comment draft is ready at
`plans/scratch/PR1092-short-draft.md`. Counter-proposal (WVA owns the KEDA ScaledObject as a
child resource) discussed but not yet added to the draft — that is the next step.

See memory `project_pr1092_analysis.md` for full recap.

## Blocked on

- **TA2 (#1052)** — 12 pending actions (ev-shindin CHANGES_REQUESTED + Claude review); see `planning/PR1052-review.md`; TA3 rebase waits on TA2 merge
- **#1113 (engine-multi-analyzer)** — e2e-smoke pending; awaiting review; engine-queue-fix PR waits on this

## Next steps

- **Now:** address 12 pending actions in TA2 (#1052) — see `planning/PR1052-review.md`
- After TA2 merges: rebase TA3, discuss TA3 PR-4+PR-5 before submitting
- After #1113 merges: open engine-queue-fix PR (force-push `01ed7d8` after rebasing onto new main tip)
- **Parallel track (NOT authorized yet):** WVA-vs-KEDA benchmark plan drafted at `planning/benchmark-wva-vs-keda-plan.md`. **Do not start coding.** The plan needs review + explicit go-ahead from Dean before any implementation begins — see the Benchmark section below.

## Benchmark: WVA vs KEDA Cost-Optimal Ramp (plan DRAFT — NOT AUTHORIZED)

> **STOP — do not begin implementation.** The plan below is a first draft. Dean has not
> yet reviewed or approved it. A new coding session that sees this entry MUST NOT start
> writing code, creating manifests, modifying the Makefile, or adding Go test files based
> on this plan. Open a discussion first, summarise the plan back to Dean, take feedback,
> and wait for an explicit "go ahead and implement" before touching any code worktree.
>
> The plan itself documents this gate at the top of `planning/benchmark-wva-vs-keda-plan.md`.
> When Dean approves, this block is removed and the status line updated.

**Plan:** `planning/benchmark-wva-vs-keda-plan.md` — Type-3 detailed plan, ~1700 lines.
Drafted 2026-05-13, **not yet reviewed/approved**.

**Headline claim:** WVA delivers 25–40% lower cost-weighted GPU-hours than a tuned KEDA
configuration at equivalent p99 ITL, because no per-deployment autoscaler can coordinate
scale decisions across variants.

**Two scenarios in the doc:**

**Scenario 1 — Cost-Optimal Ramp (§ 2–9):** Cost-efficiency argument.
- Model: `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`, decode-heavy (1000 in / 4000 out)
- Pool: two variants of the same model — L4 (cost=6) + A100 (cost=40), 1:6.7 retail ratio
- Traffic: 30-min four-phase staircase ramp, 3 → 25 RPS, Poisson
- Headline metric: cost-weighted GPU-hours at equivalent SLO

**Scenario 2 — Starvation Prevention (§ 12):** Multi-tenancy / coordination argument.
- Two tenants sharing one cluster; GPU nodes partitioned into `gpu.partition=premium|basic`
  (labels only; can run on homogeneous hardware — Option P2)
- Three variants: pool-A-gpu1 (premium tenant, constrained to premium partition),
  pool-B-gpu1 and pool-B-gpu2 (basic tenant, can use either)
- Cost weights: pool-B-gpu2=30 < pool-B-gpu1=40 — WVA's cost gradient steers Pool-B to
  basic partition, leaving premium for Pool-A
- Traffic: 18-min three-phase — Pool-B ramps first, Pool-A joins 10 min later
- Comparison adds a fourth KEDA mode: `keda-tuned-capped` (`maxReplicaCount: 0` on
  pool-B-gpu1) — the honest best-effort KEDA countermeasure
- Headline metric: Pool-A SLO violation rate during Pool-A spike phase

**Where WVA wins vs KEDA (from discussion):**
- Large, structural: **cross-variant cost selection** — no KEDA config matches this
- Modest, closable with tuning: proactive detection, cascade prevention, SLO-aware sizing
- Lead with the cost story; do not lead with latency against well-tuned KEDA

**Implementation entry points in the plan doc:**
- § 6 — kind dry-run (start here; ~35 min total, free)
- § 7.4 — kind vs OpenShift platform support table
- § 7.5 — OpenShift sizing: Option 1 (6 L4 + 3 A100-80GB), Option 2 (6 homogeneous),
  Option 3 (3-GPU smoke)
- § 8 — full implementation guide for coder agent (file layout, Go types, KEDA
  fixtures, orchestration skeleton, Makefile targets, env var contract, verification
  checklist, implementation order)
- § 8.13 — 10-step independently-testable implementation order

**Entry points for REVIEW (not for implementation) in the plan doc:**
1. § 1 — thesis and presentable overview; check the headline claim is what you want
2. § 2 — scenario design (variants, pricing, traffic pattern); check variant choice +
   cost ratio
3. § 4 — KEDA-naive and KEDA-tuned configurations; check they are fair baselines
4. § 7.5 — OpenShift sizing options; decide which option(s) to actually run
5. § 8 — implementation guide (only relevant after approval)

**Before any coding starts:**
- Dean reviews the plan end-to-end.
- Open questions resolved in conversation (e.g. cost ratio, sizing option, whether to
  extend scenario schema vs orchestrate in test code).
- Plan status changed from "Draft — NOT AUTHORIZED" to "Approved — ready for
  implementation" in the frontmatter.
- The STOP block above is removed from CURRENT.md.
- Explicit instruction from Dean: "start implementing the benchmark" (or similar).
- Only then does the coder begin at § 8.13 step 1.

**Do not (even once approved):** modify WVA controller code — this work is driver-only.

**Decisions already made (do not re-litigate):**
- Two scenarios: cost argument (§ 2–9) + starvation argument (§ 12)
- Scenario 1: three-way comparison (WVA / KEDA-naive / KEDA-tuned)
- Scenario 2: four-way comparison (adds `keda-tuned-capped` as honest best-effort)
- Decode-heavy workload — not prefill
- Staircase ramp via chained GuideLLM jobs — not schema extension (§ 2.5 Option B)
- Scenario 1 KEDA modes create **no** VA and **no** HPA (direct deployment scaling)
- KEDA-tuned uses tighter KV threshold (0.70 vs WVA's 0.80) — an honest concession
- ThroughputAnalyzer intentionally **not** enabled in this round (re-run after TA3 merges)
- Scenario 2 uses Option P2 (label-partitioned homogeneous hardware) as default — runnable
  on single-GPU-type clusters; Option P1 (true heterogeneous A100+L4) only for publication

**Benchmark future directions (not in scope for this round):**
- **Dynamic cross-tenant reallocation under a Pool-A spike** — requires WVA's Limited
  mode (not yet implemented; see `docs/design/modeling-optimization.md § Future Work:
  Limited Mode`). Scenario 2's prevention is static (cost gradient at scale-up time);
  under a sudden Pool-A spike after Pool-B already holds premium slots, WVA Unlimited
  will not migrate Pool-B off gpu1. Re-run Scenario 2 after Limited mode lands to
  demonstrate dynamic reallocation.
- **Proactive detection during rapid ramps** — re-run Scenario 1 with TA3's
  ThroughputAnalyzer enabled after TA3 merges, to expose the rate-based-detection
  advantage separately from the cost-coordination advantage.
- **SLO priority under contention** — explicit priority/criticality mechanism from
  the WVA design exists but requires Limited mode to engage. Adds a third scenario
  once that path is live.

## ENGINE PRs

### engine-multi-analyzer (PR #1113)

**Branch:** `engine-multi-analyzer` in worktree `engine-multi-analyzer/`  
**Targets:** `main` — independent of all TA branches, no TA code included.  
**Tip:** `a93bc5d` (post DCO+gofmt interactive-rebase fix, force-pushed 2026-05-10)

**Three commits:**
- `5bbe8af` — implementation: generic `analyzers` map, `runAnalyzersAndScore()`, `combineAnalyzerResults()` any-up/all-down, `engine_combine_test.go` (31 specs)
- `db59b53` — docs: Multi-Analyzer Pipeline section in `saturation-scaling-config.md` and `saturation-analyzer.md`
- `a93bc5d` — `RegisterAnalyzer(name, interfaces.Analyzer)` method on `Engine`

### engine-queue-fix

**Branch:** `engine-queue-fix` (stacked on `engine-multi-analyzer`; worktree `engine-queue-fix/`)  
**Tip:** `01ed7d8` (1 commit ahead of engine-multi-analyzer)  
**PR:** not yet opened — waiting for #1113 to merge  
**What it adds:** calls `CollectSchedulerQueueMetrics(ctx, modelID)` in `prepareModelData`; threads result through `collectV2ModelRequest` → `runAnalyzersAndScore` → `runV2AnalysisOnly` → `AnalyzerInput.SchedulerQueue`.

---

## TA PR-5: Committed on TA3

**Commit:** `8c67138` on TA3 (new hash after TA3 rebase onto TA2)

Two-line wiring in `main.go`:
```go
registration.RegisterThroughputAnalyzerQueries(sourceRegistry)
engine.RegisterAnalyzer(throughput.AnalyzerName, throughput.NewThroughputAnalyzer())
```

**TA3 compile status:** All unit tests pass (`go test ./internal/... ./pkg/... ./cmd/...`).

---

## E2E Plan: Step 1 Complete

**File:** `plans/planning/TA-e2e-plan.md` (rev 6 — 2026-04-27)

### Step 1a — PASSED (2026-04-27)
- 31/31 smoke tests in 536s
- kind cluster `kind-wva-gpu-cluster` is UP and can be reused
- WVA deployed with TA3 code (due to Makefile `IMG` always being set)

### Step 1b — PASSED (2026-04-27)
- 31/31 smoke tests in 544s
- WVA redeployed with `quay.io/dlorenz/llm-d-workload-variant-autoscaler:ta3-dev`
- EPP patch to v0.5.0 applied (version mismatch workaround)

### Step 2a–2e — COMPLETE (2026-05-11)
- 2a: cherry-picked 4 TA3 commits onto `ta3-e2e` (GPS verify, OL guard, unhealthy-pod, calibration-lock)
- 2b: built + pushed `quay.io/deanlorenz/llm-d-workload-variant-autoscaler:ta3-e2e`
- 2c: torn down cluster, rm -rf llm-d/
- 2d: fresh deploy with v0.6.0 llm-d, flow control on (E2E_TESTS_ENABLED=true); EPP v0.7.0 no crash
- 2e: **29/32 smoke tests passed** (1292s); **Scenario 1 (TA wiring) PASSED** in 210.503s
  - 3 failures in `smoke_test.go` (not throughput_analyzer_test.go) — pre-existing regressions vs newer main:
    - `:339` — "external metric item when exported_namespace is selected" (timeout)
    - `:542` — "isolated external metrics for each namespace-scoped controller"
    - `:1724` — "scale up LWS under load" (HPA desired=0 after 120s)

### E2E Infrastructure State

Kind cluster `kind-wva-gpu-cluster` — UP as of 2026-05-11.  
WVA deployed during Step 2d: `quay.io/deanlorenz/llm-d-workload-variant-autoscaler:ta3-e2e` — flow control enabled.

**Current e2e image** (TA3 + engine-multi-analyzer + queue-fix):  
`quay.io/deanlorenz/llm-d-workload-variant-autoscaler:ta3-e2e` — pushed 2026-05-11 (after cherry-picks)

To resume e2e work on this cluster:
```bash
git checkout TA3
# Run smoke (includes Scenario 1 after writing the test file):
make test-e2e-smoke ENVIRONMENT=kind-emulator
# Run full TA scenarios only:
make test-e2e-full ENVIRONMENT=kind-emulator FOCUS="ThroughputAnalyzer"
```

If the cluster is gone, redeploy following `plans/planning/TA-e2e-plan.md § Step 1a` then `§ Step 1b`.

### Known infra issues (separate PRs — not in TA3)

Details in `plans/planning/TA-e2e-plan.md § Infrastructure notes`.

1. **EPP image mismatch** — `install.sh` patches EPP to `v0.7.0` which rejects `--kv-cache-usage-percentage-metric`; llm-d values are for v0.5.0. Workaround: `kubectl set image deployment/gaie-sim-epp -n llm-d-sim epp=ghcr.io/llm-d/llm-d-inference-scheduler:v0.5.0` after deploy.
2. **Gateway interactive prompt** — `install_core.sh` fires even with `INSTALL_GATEWAY_CTRLPLANE=true` unless `E2E_TESTS_ENABLED=true`. Workaround: prefix `E2E_TESTS_ENABLED=true` before `make deploy-e2e-infra`.
3. **Makefile IMG always set** — `IMG ?= $(IMG_REPO):$(IMG_TAG)` always expands; `deploy-e2e-infra` registry-image code path is unreachable.

---

## Key Design Decisions (confirmed)

**1. engine.go is decoupled from concrete analyzer types.**  
`analyzers` is `map[string]interfaces.Analyzer`. Plugin analyzers injected from `main.go` via `RegisterAnalyzer`.

**2. Saturation always runs (even when `enabled: false`).**  
Provides `Cost` and `AcceleratorName` in VariantCapacities for the optimizer.

**3. Combine algorithm — dimensionless normalization.**
```
util_excess_i = RC_i / Σ_v(VariantCapacities_i_v.TotalCapacity)
util_slack_i  = SC_i / Σ_v(VariantCapacities_i_v.TotalCapacity)

combined.RC = max_i(util_excess_i) × sat_total   # any-up
combined.SC = min_i(util_slack_i)  × sat_total   # all-down; 0 if any analyzer disagrees
```

**4. ThroughputAnalyzerName stays in TA package** (`throughput.AnalyzerName`).

**5. Engine package stays in `saturation/` for now.**

**6. SchedulerQueue: TA handles it correctly; engine collection is a separate bug.**  
`ThroughputAnalyzer.Analyze()` already calls `estimateQueueDemand(input.SchedulerQueue, ...)` and
handles nil → 0 correctly. The gap is in `engine_v2.go` line 56 which always passes
`SchedulerQueue: nil` (TODO comment). `CollectSchedulerQueueMetrics` exists and is fully
implemented in the collector — the engine just never calls it. This affects both `saturation_v2`
and the TA equally. Fix belongs in a separate engine PR (see Issues to Open below).

**7. Tier-2 fallback B: use last fitted B across shape resets. ✅ Implemented (`7733471`).**  
On shape change, `observationWindow.Clear()` drops the tier back to Tier 2. Instead of pinning
`B = DefaultBaselineITLSec` (0.006), Tier 2 uses the last successful Tier-1 fitted B when one
exists — it reflects hardware/model characteristics, not workload shape.  
`lastFittedB float64` + `hasFittedB bool` in `variantState`; exposed in `ThroughputVariantState`.
4 new Ginkgo specs cover: save after Tier-1, survival through shape reset, Tier-2 uses it, default fallback.

## Deferred PR-3 (#1052) Fixes

Found during Claude code review; deferred to a follow-up PR after TA2 merges.

- **`DefaultWindowMaxSize` code/doc mismatch** — `constants.go` has `20`; docs table says `100`. Confirm intended value and align. (`internal/engines/analyzers/throughput/constants.go`)
- **Silent discard in `Analyze()`** — `a.Observe(...)` return value not assigned; change to `_ = a.Observe(...)` for clarity. (`analyzer.go`)
- **Misleading `CheckModelMetrics` doc** — comment says "callers should check `report.OK()` before Observe" but `Observe()` only short-circuits on `SanityIssueNoReplicas`. Reword to match actual contract. (`sanity.go`)
- **`averageShapeMetrics()` zero-count branch untested** — add test where all replicas have `IL ≤ 0` or `OL ≤ 0` and verify downstream `ShapeTracker` behavior.
- **No concurrent-access test** — add `go test -race` scenario for simultaneous `Observe()` + `VariantState()`.
- **`pod_name` fallback untested in collector** — add collector tests using `pod_name`-only labels for `GenerationTokenRate`, `KvUsageInstant`, `VLLMRequestRate`.
- **Unbounded `variantStates` map** — add eviction pass keyed on `lastObservedAt > 2×DefaultObservationMaxAge`; add `MaxLength` to `spec.modelID` CRD validation.
- **PromQL `Build()` escaping fragility** — move `EscapePromQLValue` into `Build()` or add explicit doc contract + test.
- **`SanityReport.Has()` → `slices.Contains`** — replace loop body with `return slices.Contains(r.Issues, issue)`. (`types.go`)
- **`issueSet` map → `sets.Set[SanityIssue]`** — replace `map[SanityIssue]struct{}` with `sets.New[SanityIssue]()` from `k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/sets`. (`sanity.go`)

---

## Issues to Open (post-merge)

- **Engine SchedulerQueue wiring** — ✅ implemented on `engine-queue-fix` (`01ed7d8`); PR deferred until #1113 merges. Fix threads `CollectSchedulerQueueMetrics` through `prepareModelData` → `collectV2ModelRequest` → `runAnalyzersAndScore` → `runV2AnalysisOnly` → `AnalyzerInput.SchedulerQueue`.

- **Bob review 1.3 — ArrivalRate staleness check in `computeDemand`** — defer ArrivalRate
  staleness detection (warn when `ArrivalRate` metric is stale/zero while queue is non-empty)
  to a later observability PR. Related to the Prometheus gauge work below.

- **Prometheus gauges for ITL model coefficients** — export `wva_throughput_analyzer_itl_model_a`
  and `wva_throughput_analyzer_itl_model_b` gauges (labels: `namespace`, `model_id`, `variant`,
  `tier`) so operators can graph ITL model stability in Grafana. Separate observability PR
  after PR-5 merges. (From Bob's review, 3.1)
- **EPP image version mismatch** — `install.sh` patches EPP to v0.7.0 but local llm-d is v0.5.0; file as infra bug
- **Gateway prompt bug** — `install_core.sh` fires interactive prompt when `E2E_TESTS_ENABLED=false` even with explicit `INSTALL_GATEWAY_CTRLPLANE=true`; file as infra bug
- **Makefile IMG always set** — `deploy-e2e-infra` registry-image path unreachable; file as Makefile bug
- **ndots fix standalone PR** — commit `0614d9d` on TA3 (`test/e2e/fixtures/workload_builder.go`) needs its own PR to `main` before or alongside TA3 merge
