  - planning/ta-anchor-dynamic-refresh-review.md (§ C9e — scored against R1–R4;
    § Finding 60, § Finding 61, § Finding 62, § Finding 63, § Finding 47, and the
    § "both-shape publication split" note)
note: Two factual corrections to figures in plans/session/handoffs/plan__ta-anchor-pr2-code-complete-c9-closeout.md
  are recorded there. (1) Counted over rev-list 075a208e..HEAD, 21 of 25 commit
  messages carry a plans-branch token — the numerator matches, the denominator is
  25 rather than 24 — and a9afb740's own body contains the strings N2, N3, N7, N8,
  W1, W4, U2, T1.4 and PR-2 C2, C7, C10, C11, C6e, D-b as objects of description.
  (2) docs/developer-guide/throughput-analyzer.md:609 links ../saturation-scaling-config.md,
  which from docs/developer-guide/ resolves to docs/saturation-scaling-config.md;
  that path is absent, while docs/developer-guide/saturation-scaling-config.md exists.
  Also recorded: the 54-vs-49 site figures were measured at different tips and both
  hold at theirs; the 7-vs-8 inherited gap was my own filter excluding test
  descriptions; and all 8 inherited sites are present at 075a208e and in upstream/main.
