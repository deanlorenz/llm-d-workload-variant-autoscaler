reason: move ta-pokprod-campaign-report.md to the benchmark branch
refs:
  - planning/ta-pokprod-campaign-report.md
  - planning/ta-pokprod-history.md
note: Dean-decided 2026-08-14 (D-53) -- the report belongs on the benchmark branch, not plans,
  since it's Type-6/PR-bound "guide" material describing what was tested, found, and gapped, not
  internal tracking. Target location: benchmark/docs/benchmark-reports/ (new directory, named so
  multiple campaign reports can coexist over time -- pick the specific filename). Once moved,
  its ../../benchmark/runs/... links become same-worktree relative links and resolve correctly on
  GitHub/clone, closing the cross-worktree-link gap the current draft carries. plans/planning/
  keeps a superseded-pointer stub at the old path, same pattern as the two docs this report itself
  superseded.
